# LeetCode Problem Solving Tracker

Below is a list of problems I'm working on, including the number of times I've encountered them and space to write notes.

```{python}
# Read the text file with problem data
file_path = "problems.txt"

# List to store parsed problems
problems = []

# Reading the file
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, count, url = line.strip().split(',')
        problems.append({
            'name': name,
            'count': int(count),
            'url': url
        })

# Generate markdown for each problem
for i, problem in enumerate(problems, 1):
    print(f"### {i}. [{problem['name']} ({problem['count']} times)]({problem['url']})")
    print(f"- [ ] Solved")
    print("**Notes:**")
    print("_Write a brief note about the problem here..._\n")
    print("---\n")
